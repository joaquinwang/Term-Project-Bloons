Game Name: Bloons Tower Defense

1. A short description of the project's name and what it does:

    Bloons Tower Defense is a game where a board appears with a path. The path 
    can be autogenerated or it can be built yourself. As the game goes along 
    balloons will start appearing from one side of the path and the goal of the 
    balloon is to reach the end of the path. Different balloons have different 
    speeds. The players' goal is to buy monkeys and place them, where these monkeys
    pop the balloons and make sure the balloons do not reach the end where we 
    lose health. Different monkeys attack in different speeds and have different
    reach. As you play, and as time goes on,  procedurally harder enemy 
    generation or in other words, more frequent faster balloons.

2. How to run the project:

    INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED!
    In the editor, the TermProject.py and cmu_112_graphics.py should be there. If 
    they are in the same folder, the user just needs to open the folder on VSCode
    so the two python files can show up. Once opened, you need to make sure you are 
    connected to the Internet, and just run the TermProject.py file with Command-B.

3. Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any:

    We will be importing 3 libraries. This includes cmu_112_graphics.py, import
    math and finally import random. The only library that needs to be installed or
    in your folder is cmu_112_graphics.py while the others are built in.

4. A list of any shortcut commands that exist:

    The only short cuts I've used is control-p which pauses the game and 
    control-q which quits the game.
